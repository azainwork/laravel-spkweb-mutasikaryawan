This web-based Decision Support System (DSS) is designed to help organizations determine employee transfers more effectively. It uses the ORESTE (Organization, Rangement Et Synthèse De Données Relationnelles) method for multi-criteria decision-making to rank employees based on performance, qualifications, and other key factors. The system then recommends the most suitable location for transfer based on the ranking results. With ORESTE, the decision-making process becomes more objective and structured, reducing bias and supporting HR departments in making well-informed transfer decisions. The system provides a simple interface for inputting employee data, viewing ranking results, and reviewing recommended transfer locations.
